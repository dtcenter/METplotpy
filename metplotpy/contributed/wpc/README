Description of latest code added on 8/11/2021:
ERO_verif_s_vday1.py - Runs the WPC ERO verification code and saves the most recent data
ERO_verif_p_vday1.py - Using the data from ERO_verif_s_vday1.py, creates a series of plots for the WPC ERO verification
loadAllEROData.py - A series of definitions that loads/calculates the WPC ERO verification.

METConFigGen.py - A series of primitive definitions that creates MET configuration files
METLoadEnsemble.py - A series of definitions that loads/prepares data for MTD
METPlotEnsemble.py - A series of definitions that plots MTD output

mtd_master_save_type1.py - Code that runs MTD for user selected models/ensembles (type 1)
mtd_master_save_type2.py - Code that runs MTD for user selected models/ensembles (type 2)
mtd_master_plot.py - Code that plots MTD output
py2netcdf.py - Some simple definitions that convert python output to netCDF.
