# Minimal settings specific to performance diagram plot
# All default values that are
# set in the performance_diagram_defaults.yaml configuration file will be
# used.
# Leave "empty" (as-is) to use all the settings in the performance_diagram.default.yaml
# as long as you have write permissions for the directory specified in the `plot_filename`
# setting. Otherwise, specify an appropriate plot_filename setting here (below this comment block)

# To save your log output to a file, specify a path and filename and uncomment the line below.  Make sure you have
# permissions to the directory you specify.  The default, as specified in the default config file is stdout.
#log_filename: ./default_performance_diagram.log

# To change the log level, specify a log level: debug, info, warning, error and uncomment the line below.
# The debug and info log levels will produce more log output.
#log_level: WARNING
