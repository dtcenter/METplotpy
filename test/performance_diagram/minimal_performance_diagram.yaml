# Minimal settings specific to performance diagram plot
# All default values that are
# set in the performance_diagram_defaults.yaml configuration file will be
# used.
# Leave "empty" (as-is) to use all the settings in the performance_diagram.default.yaml
# as long as you have write permissions for the directory specified in the `plot_filename`
# setting. Otherwise, specify an appropriate plot_filename setting here (below this comment block)
