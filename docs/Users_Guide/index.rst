**Foreword: A note to METplotpy users**

This User's Guide is provided as an aid to users of METplotpy.  METplotpy
contains packages for plotting in METplus as stand-alone, or part of METplus
use case, METplus wrappers, METexpress, or METviewer. It is also a component
of the unified METplus verification framework. More details about METplus can
be found on the
`METplus website <http://dtcenter.org/community-code/metplus>`_.

It is important to note here that METplotpy is an evolving software package.
This documentation describes the |release| release dated |release_date|.
Intermediate releases may include bug fixes. METplotpy is also able to accept
new modules contributed by the community. If there is code you would like to
contribute, we will gladly consider your contribution. Please create a
post in the
`METplus GitHub Discussions Forum <https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus/discussions>`_.
We will determine if we will be able to include the contribution in
a future version.
