Hovmoeller Plot
***************

Description
===========
A Hovmoeller plot is a 2D contour plot with time along one axis and a
spatial dimension along the other axis. Typically the spatial dimension
not shown has been averaged over some domain. The current METplotpy
Hovmoeller class supports only time along the vertical axis and
longitude along the horizontal axis. This can be generalized in future
releases to allow, for instance, time on the horizontal and latitude on
the vertical. The examples are based on tropical diagnostics applications,
so a meridional average of precipitation from 5 S to 5 N has been set up
in the default configuration.

Please refer to the `METplus use case documentation
<https://metplus.readthedocs.io/en/develop/generated/model_applications/s2s/UserScript_obsPrecip_obsOnly_Hovmoeller.html#sphx-glr-generated-model-applications-s2s-userscript-obsprecip-obsonly-hovmoeller-py>`_
for instructions on how to generate a Hovmoeller diagram.



Example
=======

Sample Data
___________

The sample data used to create an example Hovmoeller plot is available in
the `s2s METplus data tar file
<https://dtcenter.ucar.edu/dfiles/code/METplus/METplus_Data/v4.0/sample_data-s2s-4.0.tgz>`_  in the directory
*model_applications/s2s/UserScript_obsPrecip_obsOnly_Hovmoeller*.


Configuration Files
___________________

There is an example YAML config file located in 
*$METPLOTPY_SOURCE/METplotpy/metplotpy/plots/config/hovmoeller.yaml*

Run from the Command Line
=========================

An example Hovmoeller plot can be generated by running
**hovmoeller.py** on a command line

.. code-block:: ini

   python hovmoeller.py
