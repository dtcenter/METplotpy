**************************
Ensemble spread-skill plot
**************************

Description
===========
The theory is that RMSE of the ensemble mean should have roughly a 1-1
relationship with the ensemble spread (I.e. standard deviation of the
ensemble member values). Ensemble spread-skill plot measures that relationship.

Example
=======

Sample Data
___________

The data is text output from MET in columnar format.
The sample data used to create an example Ensemble spread-skill plot is
available in the METplotpy
repository, where the Ensemble spread-skill plot tests are located:

*$METPLOTPY_BASE/metplotpy/test/ens_ss/ens_ss.data*

*$METPLOTPY_BASE* is the directory where the METplotpy code is saved:

e.g.

*/usr/path/to/METplotpy*  if the source code was cloned or forked from the Github repository

or

*/usr/path/to/METplotpy-x.y.z*  if the source code was downloaded as a zip or gzip'd tar file from the Release link of
the Github repository.  The *x.y.z* is the release number.





Configuration Files
___________________

The Ensemble spread-skill plot utilizes YAML configuration files to indicate
where input data is located and to set plot attributes. These plot
attributes correspond to values that can be set via the METviewer
tool. YAML is a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language" and
according to `yaml.org <https://yaml.org>`_, it is a "human-friendly 
data serialization language". It is commonly used for configuration files
and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.
Two configuration files are required. The first is a default
configuration file, **ens_ss_defaults.yaml**,
which is found in the
*$METPLOTPY_BASE/metplotpy/plots/config* directory. All default
configuration files are located in the
*$METPLOTPY_BASE/metplotpy/plots/config* directory.
$METPLOTPY_BASE is the user-specified directory
where the METplotpy source code has been saved.  **Default configuration
files are automatically loaded by the plotting code and do not
need to be explicitly specified when generating a plot**.

The second required YAML configuration file is a
user-supplied "custom" configuration file that is used to customize/override
the default settings in the **ens_ss_defaults.yaml** file.
The custom configuration file can be an empty
file if all default settings are to be applied.

METplus Configuration
=====================

Default Configuration File
__________________________

The following is the *mandatory*, **ens_ss_defaults.yaml** configuration
file, which serves as a good starting point for creating a line
plot as it represents the default values set in METviewer.

.. literalinclude:: ../../metplotpy/plots/config/ens_ss_defaults.yaml

Custom Configuration File
_________________________

A second, *mandatory* configuration file is required, which is
used to customize the settings to the plot. The **custom_ens_ss.yaml**
file is included with the source code.  If the user
wishes to use all the default settings defined in the **ens_ss_defaults.yaml**
file, an empty custom configuration file can be specified instead.

.. literalinclude:: ../../test/ens_ss/custom_ens_ss.yaml

Copy this custom config file from the directory where the source code
was saved to the working directory:

.. code-block:: ini

  cp $METPLOTPY_BASE/test/ens_ss/custom_ens_ss.yaml $WORKING_DIR/custom_ens_ss.yaml

Modify the *stat_input* setting in the
*$METPLOTPY_BASE/test/ens_ss/custom_ens_ss.yaml*
file to explicitly point to the
*$METPLOTPY_BASE/test/ens_ss* directory (where
the custom config files and sample data reside).  Replace the relative path,
*./ens_ss.data*, with the full path,
*$METPLOTPY_BASE/test/ens_ss/ens_ss.data*
(including replacing *$METPLOTPY_BASE* with the full path to the METplotpy
installation on the system).  Modify the
*plot_filename* setting to point to the directory of the plot, using
the full path, including the name of the plot.

For example:

*stat_input: /username/myworkspace/METplotpy/test/ens_ss/ens_ss.data*

*plot_filename: /username/working_dir/output_plots/ens_ss.png*

This is where */username/myworkspace/METplotpy* is $METPLOTPY_BASE and
*/username/working_dir* is $WORKING_DIR.  Make sure that the
$WORKING_DIR directory that is specified exists and has the appropriate
read and write permissions.  The path listed for *plot_filename* may
be changed to the output directory of oneâ€™s choosing. If this is not set,
then the plot_filename setting specified in the 
*$METPLOTPY_BASE/metplotpy/plots/config/ens_ss_defaults.yaml*
configuration file will be used.

To save the intermediate **.points1** file (used by METviewer and
useful for debugging), set the *dump_points_1*
setting to True. Uncomment or add (if it doesn't exist) the *points_path*
setting.

For example:

*dump_points_1: 'True'*

*points_path: '/dir_to_save_points1_file'*

Replace the */dir_to_save_points1_file* to the directory where
the **.points1** file is saved.
If points_path is commented out (indicated by a '#' symbol in front of it),
remove the '#' symbol to uncomment
the points_path so that it will be used by the code.  Make sure that
this directory exists and has the appropriate read and write permissions.
**NOTE**: the *points_path* setting is **optional** and does not need
to be defined unless saving the intermediate **.points1** file is desired.


Run from the Command Line
=========================

The **custom_ens_ss.yaml** configuration file, in combination with the
**ens_ss_defaults.yaml** configuration file, generates the following plot:

.. image:: figure/ens_ss.png

Perform the following:

* If the conda environment is being used,
  verify the conda environment is running and has has the required
  Python packages outlined in the `requirements section.
  <https://metplotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Users_Guide/installation.html#python-requirements>`_
  
* Set the METPLOTPY_BASE environment variable to point to
  *$METPLOTPY_BASE*.

  For the ksh environment:

  .. code-block:: ini

    export METPLOTPY_BASE=$METPLOTPY_BASE

  For the csh environment:

  .. code-block:: ini

    setenv METPLOTPY_BASE $METPLOTPY_BASE

  Recall that *$METPLOTPY_BASE* is the directory path indicating where the METplotpy source code was saved.



* Enter the following command:

  .. code-block:: ini

    python $METPLOTPY_BASE/metplotpy/plotsens_ss.py $WORKING_DIR/custom_ens_ss.yaml

* An **ens_ss.png** output file will be created in the directory specified
  in the *plot_filename* configuration setting in the
  **custom_ens_ss.yaml** configuration file.
