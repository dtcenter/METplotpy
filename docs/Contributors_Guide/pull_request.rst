Pull Requests in Github
***********************

Please refer to the `Open a pull request using a browser
<https://metplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contributors_Guide/github_workflow.html#open-a-pull-request-using-a-browse>`_
section of the METplus Contributor’s Guide, replacing “METplus” references
with “METplotpy”. However, if external contributors are unsure who to
assign as a reviewer, a post should still be created in the
`METplus GitHub Discussions Forum
<https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus/discussions>`_
asking for help with the assignment of a reviewer, as the
METplus Discussions Forum is the centralized location for most
all METplus component questions.
