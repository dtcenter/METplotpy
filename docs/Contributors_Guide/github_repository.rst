The relevant plotting code resides in one of two directories
at the top level of the METplotpy repository:

  * plots: These plots are used by METviewer to replace original
    R script versions and can also be run from the command line
  * contributed: These plots have been contributed by other
    partners (NOAA, University of Chicago, NRL, etc.)
